- Goal of this project is to predict the natural logarithm of the loss ratio of a portfolio of auto insurance.
- Calculated impact of each feature on loss amount and performed through Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib & Seaborn to select important features for modelling.
- Implemented rigorous feature engineering by grouping multiple policies into portfolio and creating useful features using aggregation which improved MAE by 0.90 and accuracy by 40%
